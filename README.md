# Project-One
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the World Happiness Report, which uses global survey data to report how people evaluate their own lives in more than 150 countries worldwide. The World Happiness Report 2022 reveals a bright light in dark times. The pandemic brought not only pain and suffering but also an increase in social support and benevolence. As we battle the ills of disease and war, it is essential to remember the universal desire for happiness and the capacity of individuals to rally to each otherâ€™s support in times of great need. 
Our project is based on the consolidated data provided in the World Happiness Report
We use the provided data to analyse any insights to observe the trends  across multiple years or across multiple countries
From the initial data set, we clean up the data by removing any null values. The filtered data is stores in the FilteredData folder which is made avaiable to use further for this project.
We created 2 different data sets for this program.
One  Dataset holds the data for the year "2021" for all participating countries
Second Dataset is filtered for "Australia" across its participation in the past few years
We use different data visualisation and data analytical techniques to observe the trends in the given data.
