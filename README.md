# Project-One
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the World Happiness Report, which uses global survey data to report how people evaluate their own lives in more than 150 countries worldwide. The World Happiness Report 2022 reveals a bright light in dark times. The pandemic brought not only pain and suffering but also an increase in social support and benevolence. As we battle the ills of disease and war, it is essential to remember the universal desire for happiness and the capacity of individuals to rally to each otherâ€™s support in times of great need. 
Our project is based on the consolidated data provided in the World Happiness Report
We use the provided data to analyse any insights to observe the trends  across multiple years or across multiple countries
From the initial data set, we clean up the data by removing any null values. The filtered data is stores in the FilteredData folder which is made avaiable to use further for this project.

We use different data visualisation and data analytical techniques to observe the trends in the given data.

We used Happiness.xlsx as our primary data base to use our project.
First run the Happiness-CleanupData.ipynb file to clean up the Primary Dataset.
We used the Happiness-CleanupData.ipynb to clean up the data provided in the excel. We separated the data into 2 different data frames.

One  Dataset holds the data for the year "2021" for all participating countries
Second Dataset is filtered for "Australia" across its participation in the past few years
Both the files were saved into FilteredData folder and saved as AustraliaData.csv and Happiness2021.csv files.
Second file to run is Happiness-Analysis.ipynb which we will be using in analysing or visualising the filtered data
We analysed the DataFrames to project the trends in the Data and find if there is any Correlation or direct impact on other related factors.
The output generated  using the Analysis file is saved into the Images folder.
Our GIT Repo contains all the documentation inlcuding the Project proposal, Project1_Analysis_report.docx and World Happiness powerpoint slides.
